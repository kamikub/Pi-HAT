## LEDS:

The LEDs operate fairly simple. Assuming the user has selected a frequency from the buttons (see below) after singing/playing/generating the wave that they would like to test, an LED would light up. Each LED represents as follows:
Yellow- pitch is too Low.
Green- pitch is on key (optional: buzzer would sound)
Red- Pitch is too high


## Switches:

The switches are pressed to select which frequency the user would like to tune to. They are arranged in the following arrangement:

1   4
2   5
3   6

Each by default corresponds (by default) to the following frequencies:
1: 82.41 Hz  (E_2)
2: 110.00 Hz (A_2)
3: 146.83 Hz (D_3)
4: 196.00 Hz (G_3)
5: 246.94 Hz (B_3)
6: 329.63 Hz (E_4)

User may alter this by altering "freq.txt"

## Buzzer:
On default the buzzer is set to go off when the desired frequency is reached, the user is able to turn this functionality off but altering the code provided (as per the instructions)

## Others:
The rest of the devices in the subsystem are designed as the subsystem requires. These require no input/alterations from the user as it may distrupted the performance of the uHat.
