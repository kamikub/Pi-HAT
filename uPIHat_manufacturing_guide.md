## PCB manufacturing guide for the frequency tuner

A link to the Bill of Materials can be found here: https://gitlab.com/beanzille/pihat_group18/-/blob/main/BOM.md

After the PCB was completely designed using KiCad the drill files and Gerber files were
plotted and output from KiCad.

1. The drill and gerber files can be found in the following link: https://gitlab.com/beanzille/pihat_group18/-/tree/main/uHat%20integrated/meta
2. These files need to be downloaded and shared to the manufacturer.
3. The manufacturer then exports the Gerber and drill files into software they can interpret
   and the PCB is manufactured.
