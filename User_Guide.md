## How to use the uHAT Frequency Tuner

### Required:

- Raspberry Pi (with 40 pin GPIO)
- uHAT Frequency Tuner
- Instrument/desired frequency to tune to.

1. Connect the uPIHat to the Pi Zero by inserting the male pins into the female
   pins of the uPIHat
2. The Pi Zero needs to be powered first by using a desktop or pc using the micro USB port.
3. The PI Zero then powers the uPIHat.
4. Do not turn the potentiometer on the amplifier submodule, it should remain in its preset
   position unless the user is using the amplifier for its second use case (vocal trainer).
5. If the user is using the amplifier in its second use case then refer to the
   Amplifier_How_To_Guide in the repository. 
3. Select a frequency using one of the push buttons .........
